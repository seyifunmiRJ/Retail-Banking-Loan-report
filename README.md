# Project Name: Retail Banking loan Analysis Report

The dataset comprises detailed loan application records, encompassing borrower information, loan terms, financial metrics, and status. With over 40,000 entries, this dataset offers insights into lending activities and borrower profiles. The project's objectives include conducting exploratory analysis to uncover patterns, analyzing loan performance factors, building predictive models for default probability, engineering features, evaluating model performance, and developing risk mitigation strategies. The ultimate goal is to optimize lending practices, minimize risks, and enhance portfolio performance through data-driven approaches, culminating in the creation of an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring and decision support.

# Project objective: Problem Statement

The problem statement for this report revolves around the need to effectively monitor and assess the performance of lending operations through key performance indicators (KPIs). Specifically, there's a requirement to track metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-Burden-Ratio (DBR) on a Month-to-Date (MTD) basis, while also analyzing Month-over-Month (MoM) changes. Additionally, the report aims to categorize loans into Performing and Non-Performing categories, and to provide insights into their application percentage, funded amounts, and total received amounts. To address these needs comprehensively, a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status' is proposed, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and evaluate the health of the loan portfolio. Furthermore, the report will incorporate various charts such as Monthly Trends by Issue Date, Regional Analysis by State, Loan Term Analysis, Employee Length Analysis, Loan Purpose Breakdown, and Home Ownership Analysis to provide visual representations of lending metrics and trends, aiding in deeper understanding and analysis.

# Data Cleaning:

To ensure accuracy and the reliability of the analysis, the data was extracted and manipulated using SQL further cleaning was done using power query editor in Power BI. The Dashboard was created using Power BI desktop.

# Findings:

The total number of loan applications stands at 38.6k, with no noticeable change in Month-over-Month (MoM) percentage.
Total Funded Amount: The total amount of funds disbursed as loans is $435.8 million. 
Total Amount Received: The total amount received from borrowers is $473.1 million, showing a substantial increase in Month-to-Date (MTD) and MoM change.
The average interest rate across all loans is 12.05%, with a notable decrease in both MTD and MoM percentages. This could indicate a shift in lending strategies or market conditions.
The average DBR for borrowers is 13.33%, with a decrease in both MTD and MoM percentages. This could suggest improvements in borrowers' financial health or changes in lending criteria.
Performing Loans: The majority (86.2%) of loans are performing well, with 33.2k applications, $370.2 million funded, and $435.8 million received. This indicates a healthy loan portfolio.
Non-Performing Loans: Non-performing loans constitute 13.8% of the total, with 5.3k applications, $65.5 million funded, and $37.3 million received. Identifying and addressing the underlying reasons for these non-performing loans is crucial to mitigate risks.

# Recommendations:

### Data Accuracy: 
Given the significant discrepancies in MoM changes for Total Funded Amount and Total Amount Received, it's imperative to conduct a thorough data audit to ensure accuracy and reliability.
### Trend Analysis: 
Conduct a detailed analysis of lending metrics by month, state, loan term, employee length, purpose, and home ownership to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement.
### Risk Management: 
Strengthen risk management practices to minimize the impact of non-performing loans. This may involve refining underwriting criteria, enhancing borrower screening processes, and implementing proactive measures for early detection and management of delinquencies.
### Market Monitoring: 
Continuously monitor market conditions, interest rate trends, and economic indicators to adapt lending strategies accordingly and mitigate risks associated with external factors.
### Performance Monitoring: 
Implement robust monitoring mechanisms to track loan performance in real-time, enabling timely intervention and adjustment of strategies to maintain a healthy loan portfolio.
### Regulatory Compliance: 
Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and industry best practices to uphold ethical standards, mitigate legal risks, and maintain stakeholders' trust.

By addressing these recommendations and leveraging insights from the findings, the lending institution will optimize its operations, mitigate risks, and drive sustainable growth in its loan portfolio.
